## NURBS geometry

* Implementation of basic NURBS primitives
  - Bezier Curves
  - BSpline Curves
  - Bezier Surfaces
  - BSpline Surfaces

* Tessellation (fixed resolution or adaptive) of curves and surfaces
* Fundamental NURBS algorithms of NURBS
  - Knot insertion
  - Knot refinement
  - Decomposition of BSpline curves and surfaces into Bezier curves and surfaces

* Definition of regular geometry in terms of NURBS
  - Line
  - Circle
  - Bilinear Surface
  - Cylinder
  - Surface of revolution (Sphere, Cone, Torus)
